            How can I improve my mental health?<br>
            There are many different things you can do to improve your mental health, including:
            
            Staying positive. It's important to try to have a positive outlook; some ways to do that include
            Finding balance between positive and negative emotions. Staying positive doesn't mean that you never feel negative emotions, such as sadness or anger. You need to feel them so that you can move through difficult situations. They can help you to respond to a problem. But you don't want those emotions to take over. For example, it's not helpful to keep thinking about bad things that happened in the past or worry too much about the future.
            Trying to hold on to the positive emotions when you have them
            Taking a break from negative information. Know when to stop watching or reading the news. Use social media to reach out for support and feel connected to others but be careful. Don't fall for rumors, get into arguments, or negatively compare your life to others.
